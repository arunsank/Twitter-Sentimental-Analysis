# Twitter-Sentimental-Analysis
This project is a twitter sentimental analysis project based on the 2016 US election data. The main objective for us was to predict the chances of the electoral candidates HillaryClinton and Donaldtrump on various US states	
# Description 
The data extraction process for this project was critical as we had to crawl data using the Twitter API. The data extraction process involved collecting data that tweeted about the twitter handles @realDonaldTrump and @HillaryClinton. We were able to extract data from different parts of the world for our project. Since our main objective was to concentrate on the sentiments of the people in US we stuck to the tweets tweeted from different parts of the US. We were then able to create visualizations using cartograms and other visualization methods to intuitively understand the sentiments of the people from different states in the US.
